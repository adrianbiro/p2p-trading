# Example of rules for LN p2p group

Members need to understand, accept, and verbally confirm that they understand these rules. In addition to this, another requirement is a verbal guarantee by a trusted member.

What belongs here - only offers, bid, or ask for BTC over Lightning Network and LN liquidity. If you don't have an LN wallet, please let me know.


The only thing defaulty traded in the group is Bitcoin over LN and mostly in smaller amounts - millions of sats at the most. If you also want to enable on-chain payment, you have to specify so. It is recommended to start with smaller amounts, gain trust and experience at first.


If you want to make an offer, just a simple message to the group - what you buy/sell and how - physical cash, bank, Paypal, Revolut,... When your deal is done or the offer is not active anymore, delete the message if possible. When paying through digital fiat, don't add any notes mentioning crypto, Bitcoin, etc so banks don't have a reason to be suspicious.


If you are accepting an offer, write a private message directly to its creator.

Any other messages that offer don't belong to the group. Don't start discussions, don't spam members of the group, and don't leak information about your trades. Just talk directly to the trading counterparty.


As the admin of the group, I am filtering and approving all the requests. However, I cannot guarantee anything that occurs within the group; everything is done at your own risk. Please, be open, communicative, and careful while trading. I'm trying to keep track of the web of trust, so if you want to know who your trading counterparty's guarantee is, don't hesitate to ask.


Please notify me if you discover any problems with your trading counterparty, or if you discover anything suspicious. If there is anybody making problems, he will be banned.


This is a community based on a web of trust. If you want to add a new member, you can share a group link with him, but you need to let me know that you are going to guarantee his good behavior.


If you need help with anything or want to discuss anything, please visit the discussion group <link> or let me know. I am glad to help if it is within my time capabilities.
